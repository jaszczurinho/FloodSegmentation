# Flood Area Image Segmentation

## Project Description
The project aims to develop an image segmentation model that can identify and classify flood-affected areas in satellite and drone images.

## What is Image Segmentation?
Image segmentation is a process in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation and make it more meaningful for analysis. By categorizing different parts of an image, we can identify objects, boundaries, and various features within the image. In the context of flood monitoring, segmentation helps to isolate water-logged areas, buildings, and vegetation, enabling more effective disaster response and resource allocation.
